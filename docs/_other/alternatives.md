# Alternatives

Jobman aims to be reliable and fully-featured. It operates *without* requiring a system service or daemon for orchestration.

Alternative tools for similar use cases include:
* **cron**: for scheduling repeated executions of a job
* **Airflow**, **Prefect**, and **Dagster**: for managing dependencies between multiple jobs
* **supervisord**: for daemon-based job management
