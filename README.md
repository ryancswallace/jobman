Jobman is a daemonless CLI for running and managing local background jobs. It
adds retries, timeouts, durable logs, dependencies, concurrency controls, and
notifications without a resident service.

## Features

| Capability | Jobman provides... |
| --- | --- |
| Daemonless execution | A per-job supervisor that requires no shared service or privileged installation |
| Durable state | Inspectable job metadata and logs stored in a private per-user directory |
| Execution policies | Retries, repeated runs, backoff, delayed starts, and per-run or whole-job timeouts |
| Coordination | Dependencies, wait conditions, store-wide limits, and named concurrency pools |
| Lifecycle control | Status, wait, pause, resume, cancel, rerun, and live input |
| Logging | Separate stdout/stderr capture, following, rotation, and retention |
| Notifications | Named notifiers and event subscriptions with bounded delivery retries |
| Automation | Stable selectors, versioned JSON output, strict YAML configuration, and shell completions |

> [!NOTE]
> Jobman is a local, per-user process manager—not a distributed scheduler or
> backup system. Jobs can survive a closed terminal or SSH connection, but may
> end with the operating-system user session. Back up important state and logs
> independently.

## Command overview

| Task | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Submit work | `run`, `rerun` |
| Inspect work | `list`, `status`, `show`, `logs`, `wait` |
| Control work | `pause`, `resume`, `cancel`, `input` |
| Maintain Jobman | `clean`, `doctor`, `config` |

Job selectors accept a full ID, a unique ID prefix of at least eight
characters, or an unambiguous exact name. Run `jobman COMMAND --help` for all
options, or browse the [command reference].

See the [configuration reference], [sample configuration], and
[persisted-schema reference] for more info.

## Installation

Start with the package or archive that fits your operating system:

| Environment | Recommended for most users | Other available methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | [Homebrew][install-homebrew]: `brew install ryancswallace/tap/jobman` | `.tar.gz`, Go toolchain, source |
| Fedora, RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, Amazon Linux | [Signed RPM repository][install-rpm-repository], then `sudo dnf install jobman` | Downloaded `.rpm`, `.tar.gz`, Go toolchain, source |
| Debian or Ubuntu | [Downloaded `.deb`][install-deb], then `sudo apt install ./jobman_X.Y.Z_linux_amd64.deb` | `.tar.gz`, Go toolchain, source |
| Alpine Linux | [Downloaded `.apk`][install-apk], then `sudo apk add --allow-untrusted ./jobman_X.Y.Z_linux_amd64.apk` | `.tar.gz`, Go toolchain, source |
| Other Linux | [Portable `.tar.gz` release archive][install-archive] | Go toolchain, source |
| Windows | [Portable `.zip` release archive][install-windows] installed with PowerShell | Go toolchain, source |

Release artifacts include signed checksums, provenance, SBOMs, man pages, and
shell completions. Follow the [installation guide] for repository setup,
copy-paste installation and verification commands, architecture selection, and
upgrade instructions.

Jobman also publishes a Linux container image for containerized workloads. It
is not the recommended way to install the CLI on a host because detached jobs
cannot outlive their container.

Supported operating systems, architectures, lifecycle primitives, and known
platform differences are documented in the [platform support reference].
