# Install and verify Jobman

Use the recommended package or archive for your operating system unless you
have a specific reason to build from source. Package-manager installations are
usually easiest because they also install Jobman's manual page, sample
configuration, and shell completions.

Pin an exact version in automation. Before opening an existing state directory
with a newer binary, review the release notes and the
[upgrade guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/operations/upgrading/).

## Choose an installation method

| Environment | Recommended for most users | Other supported methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | [Homebrew](#install-with-homebrew-on-macos) | Portable `.tar.gz`, Go toolchain, source |
| Fedora, RHEL, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Amazon Linux | [Signed RPM repository](#install-from-the-rpm-repository) | Downloaded `.rpm`, portable `.tar.gz`, Go toolchain, source |
| Debian or Ubuntu | [Downloaded `.deb` package](#install-a-deb-package-on-debian-or-ubuntu) | Portable `.tar.gz`, Go toolchain, source |
| Alpine Linux | [Downloaded `.apk` package](#install-an-apk-package-on-alpine-linux) | Portable `.tar.gz`, Go toolchain, source |
| Other Linux distributions | [Portable `.tar.gz`](#install-a-portable-linux-or-macos-archive) | Go toolchain, source |
| Windows | [Portable `.zip`](#install-a-windows-zip) | Go toolchain, source |

The [container image](#container-image) is available for containerized
workloads, but it is not a normal host installation. A detached Jobman job
cannot outlive its container.

## Supported systems

Jobman v1 adopts the
[Go 1.26 minimum operating-system requirements](https://go.dev/wiki/MinimumRequirements):
Linux kernel 3.2 or later, macOS 12 Monterey or later, and Windows 10 or
Windows Server 2016 or later.

| Operating system | Release architectures | Release formats |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `amd64`, `arm64`, `386` | `.apk`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.tar.gz`; container for `amd64`/`arm64` |
| macOS | `amd64`, `arm64` | Homebrew formula, `.tar.gz` |
| Windows | `amd64`, `arm64`, `386` | `.zip` |

Every listed target receives a release-style compile check. Lifecycle and race
tests run natively on the current GitHub-hosted runner for each operating
system; cross-compiled architectures do not receive identical native evidence.
The state directory must be on a local filesystem with reliable SQLite WAL
locking. Jobs are scoped to the current operating-system user session even
though they can survive closing the submitting terminal or SSH connection.

## macOS

### Install with Homebrew on macOS

Homebrew is the recommended macOS installation method:

```sh
brew install ryancswallace/tap/jobman
jobman --version
```

The project-maintained formula selects the Intel or Apple Silicon release and
installs the binary, manual pages, sample configuration, and Bash and Zsh
completions. Start a new shell after installation so it discovers the
completions.

Upgrade or uninstall with:

```sh
brew upgrade ryancswallace/tap/jobman
brew uninstall jobman
```

The formula uses the same checksummed release archives described below. The
macOS executable is not yet Apple Developer ID signed or notarized, so
Gatekeeper may require explicit per-application approval. The formula does not
remove quarantine attributes or disable Gatekeeper.

If Gatekeeper blocks the first launch, verify the release, attempt the launch
once, then open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and select **Open
Anyway** for Jobman. Authenticate and confirm the next launch. Do not bypass
organization policy or disable Gatekeeper globally. See
[Apple's guidance for safely opening an unnotarized app](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445).

For an installation without Homebrew, use the
[portable archive](#install-a-portable-linux-or-macos-archive).

## Linux

### Install from the RPM repository

The signed Cloudsmith repository is recommended on Fedora, RHEL, CentOS
Stream, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Amazon Linux, and other DNF-compatible systems.
Configure it once, then install Jobman:

```sh
curl -1sLf \
  'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/jobman/stable/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' |
  sudo -E bash
sudo dnf install jobman
jobman --version
```

The setup script configures the distribution-neutral repository and its
signing key. If local policy prohibits piping a network response to a
privileged shell, download and review the script before running it. Install
future stable releases with:

```sh
sudo dnf upgrade jobman
```

### Install a DEB package on Debian or Ubuntu

Jobman does not currently publish an APT repository. The easiest installation
on Debian and Ubuntu is the native `.deb` package from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/releases). Download
the file matching your version and architecture, verify it as described under
[Verify a manual download](#verify-a-manual-download), then run:

```sh
VERSION=X.Y.Z
ARCH=amd64
sudo apt install "./jobman_${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.deb"
jobman --version
```

Use `ARCH=arm64` or `ARCH=386` where appropriate. To upgrade, download the new
package, verify it, and run the same `apt install` command with its version.

### Install an APK package on Alpine Linux

Download the `.apk` matching your version and architecture from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/releases), then
verify it as described under
[Verify a manual download](#verify-a-manual-download). The release package is
not signed with a locally trusted Alpine packaging key, so explicitly authorize
the verified local file:

```sh
VERSION=X.Y.Z
ARCH=amd64
sudo apk add --allow-untrusted "./jobman_${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.apk"
jobman --version
```

Use `ARCH=arm64` or `ARCH=386` where appropriate. To upgrade, verify the newer
package and install it with the same command.

### Install a downloaded RPM package

If you cannot configure the Cloudsmith repository, download and verify a
release RPM, then install the local package directly:

```sh
VERSION=X.Y.Z
ARCH=amd64
sudo dnf install "./jobman_${VERSION}_linux_${ARCH}.rpm"
jobman --version
```

Repository installation is preferable when available because `dnf upgrade`
can discover new Jobman versions automatically.

### What native Linux packages install

The `.apk`, `.deb`, and `.rpm` packages install:

- the `jobman` binary and manual page;
- Bash and Zsh completion scripts and their runtime dependencies;
- project and third-party license notices; and
- a preserved sample configuration at `/etc/jobman/jobman.yml`.

The packaged system configuration contains safe defaults. Per-user
configuration takes precedence, and Jobman's runtime state remains per-user by
default. Start a new shell after installation so it discovers the completion
scripts.

For Linux distributions without a matching package manager, use the
[portable archive](#install-a-portable-linux-or-macos-archive).

## Windows

### Install a Windows ZIP

The release ZIP is the recommended Windows installation. Download the ZIP,
checksum manifest, and Sigstore bundle for the desired version from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/releases). Then open
PowerShell and set the version and architecture to match the downloaded file:

```powershell
$Version = 'X.Y.Z'
$Arch = 'amd64'
$Archive = "jobman_${Version}_windows_${Arch}.zip"
$Manifest = "jobman_${Version}_checksums.txt"
$Bundle = "${Manifest}.sigstore.json"
$InstallDir = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA 'Programs\Jobman'

cosign verify-blob `
    --bundle $Bundle `
    --certificate-identity `
      'https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main' `
    --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' `
    $Manifest
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { throw 'checksum signature verification failed' }

$ChecksumLine = @(Get-Content $Manifest | Where-Object {
    ($_ -split '\s+', 2)[1] -eq $Archive
})
if ($ChecksumLine.Count -ne 1) { throw 'archive is absent or duplicated in checksum manifest' }
$ExpectedHash = ($ChecksumLine[0] -split '\s+', 2)[0].ToLowerInvariant()
$ActualHash = (Get-FileHash -LiteralPath $Archive -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLowerInvariant()
if ($ActualHash -ne $ExpectedHash) { throw 'archive checksum verification failed' }

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force $InstallDir | Out-Null
Expand-Archive -Path $Archive -DestinationPath $InstallDir -Force

$UserPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'User')
$PathEntries = @($UserPath -split ';' | Where-Object { $_ })
if ($PathEntries -notcontains $InstallDir) {
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
        'Path', (($PathEntries + $InstallDir) -join ';'), 'User'
    )
}
$env:Path = "$InstallDir;$env:Path"
jobman --version
```

The persistent `PATH` update applies to new terminals; the final assignment
makes Jobman available in the current PowerShell session. The ZIP does not
create a Windows service or machine-wide state. Its PowerShell completion file
is `docs\completions\powershell\jobman.ps1` inside the installation directory.

The Windows executable is not Authenticode signed. Its signed checksum and
provenance establish the release bytes, but they do not display a verified
Windows publisher. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may show **Windows protected
your PC**, and Windows 11 Smart App Control or enterprise policy may block the
executable. Proceed only after verification and where local policy permits; do
not weaken a managed device's security controls. See
[Microsoft's SmartScreen reputation guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/smartscreen-reputation).

## Manual release downloads

### Verify a manual download

Portable archives and downloaded Linux packages come from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/releases). Each
release also includes a checksum manifest, Sigstore bundle, SBOMs, and
provenance. Before installing a downloaded artifact, verify the manifest and
the artifact checksum:

```console
$ cosign verify-blob \
    --bundle jobman_X.Y.Z_checksums.txt.sigstore.json \
    --certificate-identity \
      'https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main' \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    jobman_X.Y.Z_checksums.txt
$ sha256sum --check jobman_X.Y.Z_checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

On macOS, use `shasum -a 256 <archive>` to compare an individual archive if
GNU `sha256sum` is unavailable. See the
[release process]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/releasing/#verifying-a-release)
for attestation and SLSA verification.

Release artifacts use names such as:

```text
jobman_X.Y.Z_linux_amd64.deb
jobman_X.Y.Z_linux_arm64.tar.gz
jobman_X.Y.Z_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
jobman_X.Y.Z_windows_amd64.zip
```

### Install a portable Linux or macOS archive

Set `VERSION`, `OS`, and `ARCH` to match the verified `.tar.gz`. Use
`OS=linux` or `OS=darwin` and a supported architecture from the table above:

```sh
VERSION=X.Y.Z
OS=linux
ARCH=amd64
ARCHIVE="jobman_${VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz"
EXTRACT_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
tar -xzf "$ARCHIVE" -C "$EXTRACT_DIR"
install -d -m 0755 "$HOME/.local/bin"
install -m 0755 "$EXTRACT_DIR/jobman" "$HOME/.local/bin/jobman"
"$HOME/.local/bin/jobman" --version
```

Ensure the per-user binary directory is on `PATH`. Add this line to your shell
startup file, such as `~/.profile`, then start a new shell:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

For a system-wide installation, replace the two `install` commands with:

```sh
sudo install -m 0755 "$EXTRACT_DIR/jobman" /usr/local/bin/jobman
```

The archive also contains the manual pages, shell completions, sample
configuration, changelog, project license, third-party notices, and citation
file. Unlike native packages and Homebrew, the binary-only commands above do
not install those supporting files automatically.

## Other installation methods

### Install with the Go toolchain

If Go 1.26.5 is already installed, install the latest tagged module without
downloading a release archive:

```sh
go install github.com/ryancswallace/jobman@latest
jobman --version
```

Ensure `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` or `GOBIN` is on `PATH`. This method builds the
binary locally and does not install manual pages, shell completions, or sample
configuration.

### Build from source

Source builds are intended for development or evaluation of the current
`main` branch. Reproducible project checks use the exact Go version recorded in
[`go.version`](https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/blob/main/go.version).
On Linux or macOS:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman.git
$ cd jobman
$ make install
```

On Windows, clone the repository and build with the Go toolchain:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman.git
Set-Location jobman
go build -o jobman.exe .
.\jobman.exe --version
```

### Container image

Jobman publishes `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` images to GitHub Container
Registry:

```console
$ docker pull ghcr.io/ryancswallace/jobman:vX.Y.Z
$ docker run --rm ghcr.io/ryancswallace/jobman:vX.Y.Z --version
```

The image contains Jobman and basic runtime utilities, not arbitrary target
commands. Read the
[container contract]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/containers/) before submitting
work. A detached job cannot outlive a short-lived container.

## Verify the installation

Run these commands after installing Jobman by any method:

```console
$ jobman --version
$ jobman doctor
$ jobman config paths
```

`doctor` opens the selected state directory and reports database, filesystem,
and lifecycle health. `config paths` shows the concrete configuration files
for the current platform without resolving secrets.

Continue with [Your first job]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/first-job/).
