# Releasing jobman

Releases are automated from tested commits on `main`. Semantic-release chooses
the next version and creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag and GitHub release; GoReleaser then
builds, signs, and publishes the release artifacts.

## Release flow

1. Merge a pull request into `main` using Conventional Commit messages.
2. The `Test` workflow runs against the new `main` commit.
3. After that workflow succeeds, the `Release` workflow previews
   semantic-release without entering the protected environment. If a release
   is required, it waits for the Test, CodeQL, Fuzz, Docs site, Docs links, and
   OpenSSF Scorecard workflows to succeed on that exact commit.
4. After the `main` environment is approved, semantic-release creates the next
   tag and a draft GitHub release.
5. GoReleaser checks out that exact tag and stages binaries, archives, native
   Linux packages, SBOMs, checksums, a checksum signature, and signed immutable
   version tags for a multi-platform GHCR image.
6. An isolated SLSA generator signs provenance for every checksummed artifact
   and uploads `jobman.intoto.jsonl` to the draft GitHub release. After the
   remote checksum, signature, and provenance assets are verified, the workflow
   publishes the GitHub release and then moves the stable `latest` container
   alias to its already signed immutable image.
7. If there are no releasable commits, the workflow exits successfully without
   creating a tag or publishing artifacts.

Release jobs are serialized and are never cancelled in progress. The workflow
does not run independently on tag pushes, which prevents duplicate publication
when semantic-release creates a tag.

## Version selection

Semantic-release follows Conventional Commits:

| Commit | Release effect | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fix:` or `perf:` | Patch | `fix: preserve job output on retry` |
| `feat:` | Minor | `feat: add retry backoff policies` |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer or `!` | Major | `feat!: change job file format` |
| `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `chore:` | No release by themselves | `docs: clarify timeout behavior` |

Use squash-merge titles that follow this convention because the commits on
`main`, not pull-request labels, determine the version.

For the first stable release, the release-triggering squash commit must carry
an explicit major-version signal, such as `feat!: freeze the v1 public
contract` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. Confirm that semantic-release selects
`v1.0.0`; do not manually replace a calculated `v0.x` tag with a v1 tag.

## Published artifacts

Each GitHub release contains:

- `.tar.gz` archives for Linux and macOS and `.zip` archives for Windows;
- `amd64`, `arm64`, and supported `386` binaries;
- `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.apk` Linux packages;
- generated man pages, Bash/Zsh completions, the sample configuration, license,
  third-party notices, README, and changelog inside the portable archives;
- SPDX JSON SBOMs for archives and native packages;
- a SHA-256 checksum manifest and a keyless Sigstore bundle for that manifest;
- a keyless, verifiable SLSA provenance bundle named `jobman.intoto.jsonl` for
  every file in the checksum manifest;
- GitHub-hosted, Sigstore-signed build provenance attestations for every file
  in the checksum manifest and every published container digest;
- keyless Sigstore signatures for the multi-platform container manifest and
  its platform-specific images.

GoReleaser also publishes `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` images to:

```text
ghcr.io/ryancswallace/jobman:<version>
ghcr.io/ryancswallace/jobman:v<version>
ghcr.io/ryancswallace/jobman:latest
```

The `latest` image is published only for stable versions. Images run as an
unprivileged `jobman` user and include Bash, CA certificates, and timezone data.
They are CLI runtimes, not persistent daemon containers: use `run --wait` or
`run --foreground`, mount `/home/jobman/.local/state/jobman`, and derive a
workload image containing target commands as described in
[docs/CONTAINERS.md](docs/CONTAINERS.md).

Immutable versioned image tags may become visible while the matching GitHub
release is still a draft. Verify the published release's digest signature and
attestation before use. The mutable `latest` alias is not moved during this
staging interval and is intentionally promoted only after the GitHub release
is public. If alias promotion then fails, the verified immutable release
remains public while `latest` remains on the preceding stable version; run the
**Repair stable container alias** workflow with the published tag to repair
that channel without rebuilding public artifacts.

Jobman v1 does not publish a Homebrew Cask. Its portable macOS archives are
covered by checksums, Sigstore, and provenance, but the executable is not Apple
Developer ID signed or notarized. A Cask would therefore be unreliable under
Gatekeeper unless it removed the quarantine attribute, which this project does
not accept as a production signing substitute. The installation guide documents
Apple's explicit per-application approval for users who accept that limitation.
Add a macOS package-manager channel only after native signing, notarization, and
install/uninstall evidence are automated.

The portable Windows executables are likewise not Authenticode signed. Their
checksums, Sigstore bundle, attestations, and provenance authenticate release
bytes but are not a Windows publisher signature; SmartScreen, Smart App
Control, or enterprise policy may warn or block them. Add Authenticode signing
only with a protected signing identity, timestamping, signature verification,
and native install evidence in the release workflow.

## Repository configuration

The workflow uses GitHub's short-lived `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no repository PAT or GPG
private key is required. Keep these workflow permissions enabled:

- `contents: write` for tags, releases, and assets;
- `packages: write` for GHCR;
- `id-token: write` for keyless Sigstore signing;
- `attestations: write` and `artifact-metadata: write` for provenance.

The isolated SLSA provenance job additionally receives `actions: read`,
`contents: write`, and `id-token: write`. The SLSA generator must be referenced
by a complete release tag such as `v2.1.0`: its verifier currently rejects a
commit-SHA reference. This is an intentional exception to the repository's
normal action-pinning policy. Dependabot monitors the tag for updates.

In **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, enable **Allow
GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** so the post-release and
scheduled repository-maintenance workflow can open its reviewed metadata pull
request. No workflow automatically approves or merges that pull request.

The workflow grants its token only the explicit write permissions listed
above. In the package settings, ensure this repository's workflow has write
access to the `jobman` GHCR package. This is required even when the workflow has
`packages: write`; an existing package can retain access settings from the
repository or token that first created it. A `403 Forbidden` while pushing
layers indicates package access, ownership, or organization-policy
configuration rather than a GoReleaser build failure.

Set the `jobman` GHCR package visibility to **Public**. Repository visibility
does not automatically make a container package public. The release workflow
runs its immutable-digest container smoke test with an empty Docker credential
store and fails before publication if the advertised anonymous pull contract
does not hold. To check the setting independently against an existing version:

```sh
anonymous_config=$(mktemp -d)
DOCKER_CONFIG="$anonymous_config" \
  docker pull ghcr.io/ryancswallace/jobman:v0.9.0
rm -rf "$anonymous_config"
```

If tag protection rules cover `v*`, allow the GitHub Actions release identity to
create those tags.

The release job uses the repository's `main` environment. Keep that environment
restricted to deployments from `main`, and retain required reviewers when
releases need a manual approval boundary. Manual recovery runs are rejected
unless the workflow itself is dispatched from `main`.

## Local validation

Install Go 1.26.5, GoReleaser 2.17, Syft, Cosign, SLSA verifier 2.7.1,
Docker with Buildx, and QEMU/binfmt for multi-platform container tests. Then
run:

```sh
make check
make docker-smoke
make snapshot
```

Snapshot mode writes artifacts to `dist/` and does not create a GitHub release.
Keyless checksum and container signing are skipped locally because they need
GitHub credentials and an Actions OIDC identity.
Docker Buildx may create local platform-suffixed images during snapshot
validation. `make snapshot` finishes by checking artifact counts, checksums,
required archive contents, absence of repository scaffolding, executable
version metadata, a tag-versioned changelog, dependency notices, and the
project-level `CITATION.cff`. The release workflow repeats the same artifact
check before generating attestations.

`make release-check` validates the release configuration without requiring a
post-release maintenance commit to have landed already. After a successful
Release workflow, repository maintenance runs automatically, verifies the
changelog section and Unreleased comparison link against the latest published
semantic version tag, and opens a reviewed pull request that updates those
records. Merge that pull request before preparing the next release candidate.

Run every target in `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` for 30 seconds and complete a
race-enabled `make soaktest` run as recorded in the [dogfood runbook] before
merging the v1 release commit. The scheduled workflows remain the authoritative
long-running evidence for that exact commit.

GoReleaser includes the tracked `CITATION.cff` directly. It intentionally
describes the project rather than an individual release, so it does not contain
error-prone version or release-date fields. Confirm the file is present inside
at least one archive.

Before merging a release-triggering change, also confirm that generated assets
are non-empty and current:

```sh
make gen-manpage gen-completions
test -s docs/manpage/jobman.1
test -s docs/completions/bash/jobman
test -s docs/completions/zsh/_jobman
```

The Release workflow now verifies successful Test, CodeQL, Docs site, Docs
links, OpenSSF Scorecard, and all four Fuzz jobs on the exact commit before it
offers the `main` environment approval. Confirm that gate, review the Soak
workflow result and the manual evidence described in `docs/DOGFOOD.md`, and
verify the previewed version. The environment approval is the final human
boundary; do not approve merely because semantic-release calculated `v1.0.0`.

## Verifying a release

Download an artifact, the checksum manifest, and its `.sigstore.json` bundle
from the same GitHub release. Verify the signature first, then the checksum:

```sh
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle jobman_<version>_checksums.txt.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity \
    'https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  jobman_<version>_checksums.txt

sha256sum --check jobman_<version>_checksums.txt --ignore-missing

gh attestation verify \
  --owner ryancswallace \
  jobman_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz

slsa-verifier verify-artifact \
  --provenance-path jobman.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/ryancswallace/jobman \
  --source-branch main \
  jobman_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

The `sha256sum` command above is available on GNU/Linux. On stock macOS,
download the one artifact you intend to verify and check only its signed
manifest record with the system `shasum` utility:

```sh
artifact=jobman_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
awk -v artifact="$artifact" \
  '$2 == artifact { print; found = 1 } END { exit !found }' \
  jobman_<version>_checksums.txt |
  shasum -a 256 --check
```

The GitHub attestation and downloadable SLSA bundle independently bind the
artifact name and digest to the release workflow and source commit. The SLSA
bundle covers all files listed by the release checksum manifest, so the same
bundle verifies any archive, native package, or SBOM from that release. Inspect
an SBOM before installation when provenance or dependency review is required.
For containers, pull an immutable version tag rather than `latest`:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/ryancswallace/jobman:<version>
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity \
    'https://github.com/ryancswallace/jobman/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/ryancswallace/jobman:<version>
```

## Recovering or retrying a release

Do not delete and recreate tags as a first response. Open the `Release` workflow,
select the `main` branch, choose **Run workflow**, and enter the existing tag
(for example, `v1.2.3`). The workflow validates the tag, checks it out, rebuilds
from that exact commit, and creates a missing draft or replaces artifacts in an
existing draft. It rejects an already published release because build dates
are embedded in binaries and image metadata: rebuilding one public tag would
silently change its bytes, checksums, and signatures. Publish a new patch
release to correct any artifact that has already become public.

The recovery tag must identify the current `main` commit selected by the
dispatch, its GitHub release must be absent or still a draft, and all required
exact-commit workflow results must remain available and successful. This
constraint keeps artifact attestations bound to the workflow's actual source
commit, prevents an old recovery from moving `latest` backward, and prevents
the input from publishing an arbitrary repository tag.

This path also recovers the narrow failure window in which semantic-release
successfully pushed the tag but did not create the draft GitHub release. If
`main` has advanced since the tagged release attempt, do not use an old-tag
workflow dispatch: publish a newly tested patch release instead.

If no release exists yet, GoReleaser creates the draft; otherwise, recovery
keeps the incomplete release private while replacing its asset set. Run it only
while the tag is still at current `main`. Never undraft an incomplete
replacement manually: first complete a successful retry and verify every
checksummed asset, the checksum signature, and provenance.

If the GitHub release is already public but only the mutable GHCR `latest`
alias failed to move, do not rebuild or redraft the release. Run the **Repair
stable container alias** workflow from `main` with the published tag. That
workflow requires the tag to be GitHub's latest stable release, verifies the
immutable image's release-workflow signature, promotes the alias, and confirms
both names resolve to the same manifest digest. It then resumes the
post-release repository-maintenance workflow that the failed publication job
could not trigger.

If GitHub has expired the tagged commit's workflow records, the automated
recovery intentionally fails closed. Rebuild on an isolated host for diagnosis,
then publish a new patch release from a newly tested `main` commit rather than
bypassing provenance or exact-commit gates for the old tag.

Before retrying, diagnose the failed publishing stage:

- GHCR failures usually indicate missing package write access;
- signing failures usually indicate missing `id-token: write` permission;
- a missing `jobman.intoto.jsonl` asset usually indicates that the isolated
  provenance job could not read the release or obtain its OIDC identity;
- an absent man page or completion file means the generator failed or produced
  an empty file;
- a duplicate asset error should be handled automatically by GoReleaser's
  `replace_existing_artifacts` setting.

Only remove a tag or release when it points at the wrong commit or exposed an
artifact that must be revoked. Document that incident before publishing a new
version; released version numbers should not be reused for different source.

## Manual preflight for maintainers

Before relying on the first stable release:

- confirm the latest `Test` run on `main` is green;
- check that all release-worthy commits use Conventional Commit syntax;
- run the local snapshot commands above;
- verify GitHub Actions, GHCR, and tag-protection permissions;
- verify the `main` environment's deployment protection rules;
- confirm the `jobman` GHCR package grants this repository's Actions workflow
  write access, especially if the package already exists;
- review the generated GitHub release notes and all artifacts after publication;
- install at least one archive or native package and run the versioned
  container;
- review the v1 release-commit checklist in [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md), including
  README warnings, security support, platform evidence, upgrades, changelog,
  every fuzz target, performance/soak results, and `make docker-smoke`.
